  _info: Which of the following is an advantage of adjacency list representation
    over adjacency matrix representation of a graph?
  _answers:
  - _info: In adjacency list representation, space is saved for sparse graphs.
    _isCorrect: 0
  - _info: DFS and BSF can be done in O(V + E) time for adjacency list representation.
      These operations take O(V^2) time in adjacency matrix representation. Here
      is V and E are number of vertices and edges respectively.
    _isCorrect: 0
  - _info: Adding a vertex in adjacency list representation is easier than adjacency
      matrix representation.
    _isCorrect: 0
  - _info: All of the above
